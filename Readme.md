## Type annotations

We (developer) tell Typescript the type.

`const name : string;`

---

## Type interface

Typescript guess the type because of the initial value we have provided.

`const name = 'Sagar';`

Here, type of `name` becomes string implicitely, because we are assigning it with the string value on its right.
